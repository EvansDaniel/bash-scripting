# bash-scripting
Useful home-grown bash commands

1. countlines: call with countlines [java,cpp,python,any other language name...] [/path/to/git/repo]
2. csmv, csprepend, genpage: These commands are useful for my multimedia programming class where I have to upload my homework and post pictures of code output to a wiki. genpage auto generates the wiki page, csmv moves the web exports of the code onto the cs serve at my university, csprepend appends a header string to all my homework files.
3. install_laravel_deps: This command will install the necessary php extensions to run the Laravel framework. Furthermore, it will install Composer, which is a php package manager. This makes it a lot easier to install Laravel quickly on several Linux machines.
